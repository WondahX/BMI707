Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may influence leukocyte telomere length (LTL),1 a biomarker associated with chronic disease. In vitro research suggests dioxins may bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and induce telomerase activity,2 which elongates LTL. In this project, we aim to use persistent organic pollutant exposures as well as other demographic features to predict the length of LTL among 1003 U.S. adults.

We will use data from the National health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001 to 2002. In addition to the length of LTL, it contains:
11 PCB exposures, namely PCB 74, 99, 118, 138, 153, 170, 180, 187, 194;
3 Dixoin exposures, namely Dioxin 1, 2, 3;
4 Furan exposures, namely Furan 1, 2, 3;
6 blood biomarkers, including white blood cell count, lymphocyte percent, monocyte percent, eosinophils percent, basephiles percent, and segmented neutrophils percent;
1 biomarker for conitine;
5 demographic features, including sex, age at screening, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and education level.

We aim to use neural networks to solve this regression problem. We will trymore advanced neural network models in the project with the progression of the class.
